Description: This package implements gene and gene-set level analysis
        methods for somatic mutation studies of cancer.  The gene-level
        methods distinguish between driver genes (which play an active
        role in tumorigenesis) and passenger genes (which are mutated
        in tumor samples, but have no role in tumorigenesis) and
        incorporate a two-stage study design.  The gene-set methods
        implement a patient-oriented approach, which calculates
        gene-set scores for each sample, then combines them across
        samples; a gene-oriented approach which uses the Wilcoxon test
        is also provided for comparison.
